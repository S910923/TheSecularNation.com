                       One of the most renowned news reporting channels ABP News on this channel a show used to come out that was Masterstroke on this show the news was played in an unbiased way. On 20 June 2018 modi and some farmers were video called by pm modi, modi asked” how much your salary or pay has been increased ”  One female farmer replied “ our salary or pay has been increased by two times” on that video call BJP was trying to show people that yes BJP is working for India, but some ABP news report went to  the farmers and started asking the question that were asked by modi so they replied “no our pay or salary has not increased but the pay or salary was decreased they were living in loss”. 

                       The ABP news channel started showing the real truth of BJP on Masterstroke but BJP did not liked that at all so, many BJP leaders or politicians started giving classification on social media like twitter,Facebook etc so to recheck again some ABP news reporter went and this time they went to the head of village or surrpange of the village and the surrpange replied “ some officials came from delhi  to their village so that all answers which will be asked from modi so the answers should be according to that they were told to say that answers only which they have written on paper ”


                 this time no minister have the classification of the above matter so this time BJP tried to suppress that masterstock channel by whenever masterstroke was used to come on abp news so the news channel started blackout from 9:30 pm to 10 pm and that was the time for masterstroke to came so I think BJP government try manipulate news.</span></p>

<h3 class="text-3xl font-medium text-gray-850 title-font mb-2">  <mark> Let reach to the roots </mark> </h3>  <br>
<br>

In 2002 there was a Gujrat Riots  also known as the 2002 Gujarat violence. was a three-day period of inter-communal violence in the western indian state of Gujarat. The burning train in Godhra on 27 February 2002, which caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims  returning from Ayodhya, is cited as having instigated the violence. Riot incidents, there were further outbreaks of violence in Ahmedabad for three months; statewide, there were further outbreaks of Violence of Gujarat for the next one year.


According to official figures, the riots ended with 1,044 dead, 223 missing, and 2,500 injured. Of the dead, 790 were Muslim and 254 Hindu. The Concerned Citizens Tribunal Report, estimated that as many as 1,926 may have been killed. Other sources estimated death tolls in excess of 2,000. Many brutal killings and rapes were reported on as well as widespread looting and destruction of property. Narendra Modi, then chief minister of Gujrat  and later Prime minister of India , was accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police and government officials who allegedly directed the rioters and gave lists of Muslim-owned properties to them through. 
The hindu muslim cat and dog fight is the political propogenda off bjp government to distract people from their wrong/illegal working   for example Sohrabuddin case. In this case Amit Shah went to jail because he was also charged with rape & kiddnapping case. 

Not only Amit Shah there were some more political leaders of BJP who were in jail till 2014 in the case of ishrat jahan case & Sohrabuddin case 
But when modi became a PM all the guilty one were bailed from jail but why? 

When Modi was the Chief Minister of gujarat  his visa for USA was not approved by U.S. Embassy Due to the above matter Modi was banned from  USA. <br>

<br>


<h3 class="text-3xl font-medium text-gray-850 title-font mb-2">  <mark> Why Narendra Modi Was Banned From the U.S. </mark> </h3>  <br>

<br>


Narendra Modi did not take substantial action against the perpetrators of riots in Gujarat which followed immediately after the burning of 60 Hindus alive in a train in Godhra. Post Godhra riots claimed around 1000 lives (700 Muslims and 300 Hindus approx.). It was alleged that after Godhra, the riots involved gross violation of human rights while the state was alleged to covertly help the rioters. Modi being the head of the State was held responsible for this 'allegation'

The law of the land applies if at all any crime has been done. So if at all a law was broken by Modi, he had to face the laws of India and consequences thereafter. We saw numerous cases and investigations against him or to frame him did not produce any result. Even Supreme COurt monitored SIT could not charge him . So the talk that US wanted to punish him for Human Rights violation.

Modi said it was a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local Muslims, his words contributing to the rapidly growing riots that resulted in more than 1000 deaths, of which 790 were from the Islamic community.
Human rights groups accused Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of essentially ignoring killings by its Hindu extremist allies.Scholars have roundly agreed that the Gujarat government was complicit in the riots, with some even alleging that it amounted to ethnic cleansing.

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium text-gray-850 title-font mb-2">  <mark> What is  cryptocurrency? </mark> </h3>  <br>
                   
                  <br>
                  Cryptocurrency is a form of currency that only exists
                  digitally, that usually has no central issuing or
                  regulating authority.
                  Some of the cryptography used in cryptocurrency
                  today was originally developed for military
                  applications. At one point, the government wanted to
                  put controls on cryptography similar to the legal
                  restrictions on weapons, but the right for civilians to
                  use cryptography was secured on grounds of freedom of speech.<br>
                  <br>
                  <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium text-gray-850 title-font mb-2">  <mark>  Total Revenue </mark> </h3>  <br>
                
                  <br>
                  The yearly revenue of cryptocurrency was $1140 million in 2020 with a profit
                  of $322 million & in 2021 the yearly revenue right now is $1800million with a
                  profit of $765 million. Right now the current value of bitcoin is 35,08,530.03
                  Indian Rupee.<br>
                  <br>
                  <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium text-gray-850 title-font mb-2">  <mark> Is cryptocurrency Legal or Illegal?  </mark> </h3>  <br>

                  <br>
                  Cryptocurrencies are not illegal; anybody can buy, sell and trade
                  cryptocurrencies. It’s unregulated; we do not have a regulatory framework to
                  govern its functioning for now however India is looking to ban cryptocurrency.<br>
                  <br>
                  <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium text-gray-850 title-font mb-2">  <mark>  Why RBI want’s to ban Cryptocurrency? </mark> </h3>  <br>
                  
                  <br>
                  In 2018, RBI issued a circular to take down crypto currencies from the
                  Indian virtual trade. The Internet Mobile Association Industry- a non profit
                  organization and a group of corporations dealing in crypto exchange
                  platforms stood up against this circular in the Supreme court.<br>
                  <br>
                  Bitcoin, for instance, is a relatively poor choice for conducting illegal business
                  online, since the forensic analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain has helped
                  authorities arrest and prosecute criminals. More privacy-oriented coins do
                  exist, however, such as Dash, Monero, or ZCash, which are far more difficult
                  to trace.<br>
                  <br>
                  The semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them
                  well-suited for a host of illegal activities, such as money laundering and tax
                  evasion. However, cryptocurrency advocates often highly value their
                  anonymity, citing benefits of privacy like protection for whistleblowers or
                  activists living under repressive governments. Some cryptocurrencies are
                  more private than others.<br>
                  <br>
                  An alleged mastermind of a cryptocurrency scam has been arrested in India after he
                  fled the country to Dubai. Investors were duped into investing in a cryptocurrency
                  linked to a crypto exchange he established. The scheme also promised investors a
                  monthly return of 20%-30% on investments.
